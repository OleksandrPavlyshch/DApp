# Questionnaire
1. How much time did it take you?
  - It took me around 2 hours total, with time divided between planning, coding, and testing.
2. How did you think about testing your code?
  - I concentrated on writing unit tests for the utility functions within the lib folder, ensuring they function as expected independently
3. How did you verify your solution meets the requirements?
  - I mapped each requirement to specific test cases and performed manual testing to ensure all functionalities were covered and user-friendly.
4. What tradeoffs did you make and why?
  - I prioritized the development of core utilities and their tests, which are crucial for the project's foundation, over broader application testing.
5. Shortcuts are encouraged to keep time investment of the assignment minimal. What shortcuts did you take? Anything you specifically want to mention that you wouldnâ€™t normally do?
  - To manage time efficiently, I focused on essential tests and assumed certain standard inputs for utilities, which sped up the initial testing phase.
6. What was tricky and why?
  - Ensuring the utility functions were robust and flexible enough.
